# Dependencies

go-pkicmp-ng is a modified derivative of [tsaarni/go-pkicmp](https://github.com/tsaarni/go-pkicmp), as [NOTICE](NOTICE) records. Other third-party code is consumed through versioned packages.

Exact Go versions and checksums are in `go.mod` and `go.sum`. The EJBCA and nginx images are pinned in
`test/integration/ejbca/docker-compose.yml`, the CMP test suite commit in the `Makefile` and the OpenSSL
release in `.github/workflows/integration.yml`. Only golang.org/x/crypto is a dependency of the library
itself. The others are used by its tests. Each dependency retains its own license and notices in the
downloaded module or distribution.
