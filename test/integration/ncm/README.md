# Nokia NCM integration tests

Integration tests for the CMP client against a [Nokia NCM](https://www.nokia.com/networks/products/pki-authority-with-netguard-certificate-manager/) instance. They cover:

* P10CR enrollment protected with PasswordBasedMac
* P10CR enrollment protected with a signature
* P10CR re-enrollment of an identity NCM has already certified
* KUR with a new key
* KUR with the existing key

Every certificate must certify the requested key and chain to the configured trust anchor. The client confirms each one with `certConf` and verifies the `pkiConf`.

## Running the tests

Set the variables below and run:

```bash
make test-integration-ncm
```

Each test skips when the configuration it needs is missing. Without an endpoint the whole package skips, so `make test-integration` passes without NCM.

The [NCM interoperability](../../../.github/workflows/interop-ncm.yml) workflow runs the tests for pushes to `dev` and `main`, once a week and on request. It reads the same names from the repository secrets and variables. It runs one job per configured transport and never runs for pull requests.

## Configuration

These values are secrets in the repository. Store them as secrets, not variables, so a run against a private instance does not print them in the log.

| Secret | Required | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NCM_CMP_HTTP_URL` | one URL at least | Plain HTTP CMP endpoint, for example `http://ncm.example:8080/pkix/` |
| `NCM_CMP_HTTPS_URL` | one URL at least | HTTPS CMP endpoint |
| `NCM_CMP_RECIPIENT_DN` | yes | Name of the issuing CA, for example `C=DE,O=Example,CN=Issuing CA`. `C`, `ST`, `L`, `STREET`, `POSTALCODE`, `O`, `OU`, `CN` and `SERIALNUMBER` are supported |
| `NCM_CMP_RESPONSE_TRUST` | yes | PEM anchors that sign the CMP responses and the issued certificates |
| `NCM_CMP_PBM_REFERENCE` | for PasswordBasedMac | Reference number of the shared secret, sent as `senderKID` |
| `NCM_CMP_PBM_SECRET` | for PasswordBasedMac | Shared secret |
| `NCM_CMP_BOOTSTRAP_CERT` | for signatures | PEM certificate that signs the enrollment requests |
| `NCM_CMP_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` | for signatures | PEM private key of that certificate |
| `NCM_CMP_BOOTSTRAP_CHAIN` | no | PEM issuers of that certificate, sent in `extraCerts` |
| `NCM_CMP_HTTPS_TRUST` | no | PEM anchors for the HTTPS server certificate when it is not publicly trusted |

These are repository variables:

| Variable | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `NCM_CMP_COMMON_NAME` | Common name for the enrollment tests. Unset gives `go-pkicmp-ng-test-<UTC YYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<test>` |
| `NCM_CMP_COUNTRY` | Country requested in the subject. Omitted when unset |
| `NCM_CMP_ORGANIZATION` | Organization requested in the subject. Omitted when unset |
| `NCM_CMP_KUR` | `false` skips both key update tests |
| `NCM_CMP_KUR_SAME_KEY` | `false` skips the key update that keeps the existing key |
| `NCM_CMP_REENROLL` | `false` skips the re-enrollment test |

PasswordBasedMac uses SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256 and 1024 iterations. The re-enrollment and key update tests enroll with PasswordBasedMac when it is configured and with the bootstrap signature otherwise. A key update is signed by the certificate it replaces and is sent to the enrollment endpoint.

The key update tests always enroll under a generated name, because a profile that authorizes only `NCM_CMP_COMMON_NAME` could not certify a second identity.

## Server profile

The tests expect a profile that:

* accepts P10CR with the configured protection
* certifies an identity again when it is re-enrolled
* accepts KUR signed by a certificate it issued and certifies the same key twice for the same-key update

Turn off the tests a profile does not allow with the variables above.

NCM answers with HTTP 503 and no CMP message once a host exceeds its request rate limit. The limit counts every CMP message, `certConf` included. The tests therefore run one after another, send at most one request every 1.5 seconds and send a refused request again after a pause. NCM refuses such a request before it parses it, so sending it again does not repeat a transaction.
